Our mission at Astronomer is to help organizations adopt [Apache Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/).

Since our inception, we've garnered a group of Airflow aficionados and experts who are dedicated to doing what they can to see that your team succeeds.

To supplememt our two products, both of which significantly facilitate DAG and deployment management, we've curated a variety of support options.

We're human - and you're human. We want you to have a face to our name.

## Standard Support (Included)

We support *all* Astronomer Customers with a few flavors of basic support options meant to supplement both our product and documentation.

- If you run into a one-off technical issue, you can file a support ticket by shooting an email to **support@astronomer.io**. These issues are triaged regularly, and you can expect to hear back from us within 24 hours (usually sooner).

- If you have a specific feature request or are curious about platform-wide issues our engineering team is tackling, you can track and open up issues in [this repo]()

- If you're interested in being a part of an Astronomer-focused Airflow community forum, reach out to **paola@astronomer.io**. The forum recently went live and is currently invite-only, but we'd love to see it grow, and we'd love to see you in it.

## Premium Slack Channel Support

- If you're looking for 1:1 attention from us, we've found that a private, shared slack channel between our two teams is a worthwile investment. We'll walk you through troubleshooting in real-time, hop on a screenshare if necessary, and share insights, gotchas and best practices that other customers might not get access to as easily.

- If you want to know more about this option, check out our pricing page. If you're interested in tacking this on to your current plan, reach out to our Head of Customer, Paola Peraza (paola@astronomer.io)

## Astronomer SpaceCamp

- SpaceCamp is our Apache Airflow training and education program for teams looking to run Airflow at scale. (Think: We come to your office for a few days, and get your team ramped up on Airflow).
