  # As of version 0.7.0, we deploy an image that exposes this metric
  # as a counter instead of a gauge. (https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow/pull/4027).
  # As a result we need to account for this as we transition already running
  # deployments to the latest docker iamge. This additional label lets us fix up our alerts and dashboards.
